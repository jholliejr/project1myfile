# Dallas County Residential Home Values Analysis


## Analysis Summary
From a local perspective, the mean home price in Dallas County increased in a five-year span covering the beginning of 2016 to the beginning of 2020.  All 29 cities within the county moved in a positive correlation with the county’s values.  The same can be said for the 16 independent school districts, although one was removed due to its sample size of only (23) properties.
In terms of sales price, the least expensive homes, priced below or equal to $150k, performed the best in terms of total value appreciation.  Second in appreciation performance was the price range of $150k to $300, which is where a majority of the first-time homebuyer floorplans (typically 3 bedrooms) are located.  Third and fourth in total value appreciation were affluent homebuyers ($300k to $600k) and luxury homebuyers (above $600k), respectively.  The affordable group ($0-$150k) particularly shined when the mortgage interest rates dipped in 2018, suggesting that an ease in financing obstacles increased demand for affordable housing units.
When we included some national statistics for comparison, namely the gross domestic product, unemployment and the S&P 500, we found a positive correlation between the Dallas County residential home prices and the gross domestic product, and a negative, or inverse relationship, with unemployment.  The unemployment relationship with the Dallas County home prices would be the “truest” influencer, stating as unemployment goes down and jobs are plentiful, the home prices in the county are stable or appreciate.  As for the S&P 500, there was no clear relationship established with the county home prices.  The S&P 500, considered a popular stock market benchmark, generally has trended upwards over the past few years.  However, the confluence of several factors such as politics and international trade maneuverers, had a negative impact on the S&P 500 in 2018, resulting in an annualized loss of (4.31%).  Consequently, our current data suggests that the S&P 500 and Dallas County home prices move independently of each other.

## Bottom 5 Cities in Dallas County by Value
The bottom 5 movers over the past 5 years, in terms of total percentage increase in value, were Addison, Highland Park, University Park, Combine and Coppell.  It should be re-stated that all of the cities in this analysis, including these bottom 5 movers, increased in value over the analyzed time period.  These “bottom” 5 had the lowest increases in total value during that span.

## County Home Value Influencers
Based on our data, the clear catalyst for home value performance is unemployment.  A second driver is home price.  The homes priced below $150k are appreciating the quickest.  Movement in mortgage interest rates is not a catalyst for home values, but rather impacts the access to financing options.  As more financial products come online to serve a broader group of potential buyers, the ability to purchase available housing units increases.

## Dallas County Home Value Projections
Our 3-year simulation is projecting a decrease in mortgage interest rates.  As stated previously, better financing terms in an environment of low unemployment, should increase demand for all housing.  The most significant impact of lower mortgage interest rates should be on the most affordable homes in the range below $150k.  Consequently, those units should perform the best in terms of value stability or appreciation over the next three years.
